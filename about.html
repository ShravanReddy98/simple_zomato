    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    <font size="4" color="#333333"
      >&emsp; Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and
      Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a
      restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company
      Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and
      also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay

      Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. In 2012, it expanded operations
      internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates,
      Sri Lanka, Qatar, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and South Africa.
      In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with
      websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and

      In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal
      Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and
      Australia. This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with
      similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare. </font
